Hello.
This is the README and also the main page of the wiki.

Be sure to set `ROOT_PAGES` in `server_config.py` and all the other configs.

Search for expressions in all `ROOT_PAGES` files in the search bar, e.g., by writing `map` and hitting enter.

Expressions with an `.` in it are interpreted as files to open, e.g., `presheaf.txt`.

Tested on the latest MacOS. Run via `python main.py`. Then go to `http://127.0.0.1:8080/`.

The flask is used in a very minimalist way, so there's lots of room for introducing best practices.
The python plugging of the html scheme is also very hacky right now.
I also have some ideas, so ask if interested.

So I'm quite happy for PR's or hints and also feature ideas!
