===== Intuitionistic propositional logic =====
==== Framework ====
We consider a logic with the standard [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_connective|connectives]], adopt the standard usage of brackets for separation of expressions and predicates, and we use the usual binding strengths in term construction.

The atomic propositions will be denoted with capital Latin letters here, e.g. $A,B,C,P,Q,...$. Formally, their semantic meaning is not at all relevant.

So the symbols of the logical language are those letters and
$\land$, $\lor$, $\Rightarrow$, $\bot$ and $\Leftrightarrow$, $\neg$, $\top$ as well as the two symbols $($ and $)$.

The Latin Letters represent some claim ($R$ could be "It's raining right now") and the logical symbols are taken to mean to "and", "or", "if-then", the proposition "is absurd" and "if and only if" resp. "not the case that" and the proposition "it's always the case".

We want to formally express what expressions count as syntactically correct propositions.
To make such //judgements//, we consider well formed formulas to be terms of the type $\mathrm{Prop}$. Write $P : \mathrm{Prop}$ for "$P$ is a Proposition".

At the same time, this gives us a notion of proof, see below.

Remark:
We may consider a mathematical framework which includes a type of types $\mathrm{Type}$ and formalize "Proposition are a type" by $\mathrm{Prop}:\mathrm{Type}$, but thoughts along that line will certainly not be relevant as long as we only deal with propositions and no other things.

=== Derivation rules ===
Let $A$, $B$ and $C$ be some claims and consider the last sentence.

We might take the following argument to be a proof of this statement:

If we have established that $A\land B$ holds, then in particular $B$ holds. If moreover we have established that $B\Rightarrow C$ holds, then, as $B$ is the condition $B\Rightarrow C$, we can put the two together to establish that $C$ holds.

We introduce notation to capture this sentence, which is briefly discussed in [[Logic]]: Formally, //Derivations// can be considered trees and the proof presented as

${\large\frac{{\large\frac{(A\land B)\ :\ \mathrm{True}}{B\ :\ \mathrm{True}}}(\land E_2)\hspace{.5cm}(B\Rightarrow C)\ :\ \mathrm{True}}{C\ :\ \mathrm{True}}}(\Rightarrow E)$

As derivations only go from true propositions to other true ones, we may drop the "$:\mathrm{True}$" and write

${\large\frac{{\large\frac{(A\land B)}{B}}(\land E_2)\hspace{.5cm}(B\Rightarrow C)}{C}}(\Rightarrow E)$

...

=== Double-negation translation ===
When it comes to classically interpreted propositions, classical propositional logic and intuitionistic propositional logic have the same proof strength (although proving theorems in classical logic might be more straight forward).
This is because if the former proves $P$, then the latter always proves classically equivalent statements such as $\neg\neg P$ (and the converse of this is trivial).
So to prove any (classically provable) theorem $P$, you can start out and stick to the intuitionistic framework the whole time, up until the end where, having proven $\neg\neg P$ intuitionistically, you apply an non-constructive (purely classical) translation such as $\neg\neg P\to P$.

This can be extended to a theory with existential quantifier. It can also be extended to the universal quantifier, except the translaion is more intricate.

== Proof of the double negation of LEM ==
Using the classical equialence $P\leftrightarrow \neg\neg P$ and $\neg(P\land Q)\leftrightarrow(\neg P\lor\neg Q)$, we get the classical equivalences

$(A\lor\neg A)$

$\leftrightarrow (\neg\neg A\lor \neg\neg A)$

$\leftrightarrow \neg(\neg A\land \neg\neg A)$

$\leftrightarrow \neg\neg\neg(\neg A\land \neg\neg A)$

The last two can be proven constructively.

In fact, take any $A,B$ and observe that

$((A\to B)\land((A\to B)\to B))\to B$

"If it's the case that '$A$ implies $B$' and also that '$A$ implies $B$' implies $B$, then $B$ is the case."

Under the BHK interpretation (Curry-Howard), this reads"

"Given any 'function to $B$', that we may call $f$, as well as a function $F$ from a 'functions to $B$' to $B$, you can construct an element of $B$."

The proof / the element is of course $F(f)$. In type theory, that judgement is

$\lambda x.(\pi_2x)(\pi_1 x)\ :\ (A\to B)\times((A\to B)\to B)\to B$

where in the above notation $x=(f,F)$ so that the lambda expression denotes the function $(f,F)\mapsto F(f)$.

If we now consider $B$ to be absurdity resp. the empty type $\bot$, then we have proof resp. a term of

$(A\to\bot)\times((A\to\bot)\to\bot)\to\bot$

which using $\neg X \equiv X\to\bot$ and $\land\equiv\times$ reads

$\neg(\neg A\land\neg\neg A)$

"If it's the case that 'A leads to an absurdity' and also that 'A leads to an absurdity' leads to an absurdity, then this leads to an absurdity."

QED

The classically equivalent

$\neg\neg A\lor \neg\neg\neg A$

means

"Either 'A leading to an absudity is absurd' or 'A leading to an absudity is absurd' is absurd."

and

$A\lor\neg A$.

means

"Either A holds or it leads to an absurdity."
